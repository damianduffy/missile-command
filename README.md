# FURTHER DEV:
 - bomber planes
 - satelites / UFOs
 - multi-warhead
 - colourful explosions
 - hilly terrain
 - cities that can be partially destroyed
     - civilian death count
OR
 - have missiles target specific cities
 - explosion on ground creates semi-circle / masked by ground instead of circle
 - break event handler into seperate class
 - consider detonating warhead instead of just removing the missile on destruction
